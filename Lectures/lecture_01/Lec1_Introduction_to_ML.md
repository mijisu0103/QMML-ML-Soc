## What is Artificial Intelligence?

> Artificial intelligence (AI) is the broader field focused 
on creating machines capable of performing tasks that 
mimic human intelligence, such as reasoning, planning, 
and language understanding. Machine learning (ML), a 
subset of AI, specifically involves algorithms that 
enable machines to learn from data and improve 
automatically, without explicit programming for each 
task. – GPT-4o
